Oh this is a beast that does not exist in reality.
People did not know it, but certainly this beast
- I loved walking and going nods - to the light of that quiet gaze - again.

Indeed this did not exist.
However, it was born from people's love of it.
A pure beast. People always left space open.
Then in that clearly held space
The beast lightly bow his head and almost no more
There was no need to exist.
People fed it only with the possibility of existence, not grain, all the time.
And that possibility will give power to this beast

A horn grew from the forehead. A horn is.
And the beast approached a single girl in white form -
It continued to exist in the silver mirror and her.
