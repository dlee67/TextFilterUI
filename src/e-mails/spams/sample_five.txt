College is over. Almost. Woohoo!!

 

On the one hand, you’ll miss the classroom debates, the free tee shirts that are handed out like candy, and of course, rocking up to class in your pajamas (#noshame). On the other hand, you’re probably thinking,

 

‘What am I doing with the rest of my life?’

 

Glad you asked.

 

My name is Charisma Lawler and I have been retained by a large privately-held company that thinks that smart, hardworking individuals like you deserve the opportunity to move up faster in their career life. If your Bachelor’s GPA is 3.5 or higher and you’re interested in a career in IT management, you’ve got our attention.

 

Large companies like us are absolute MONEY because they are well aware that recent college graduates have the latest knowledge and the intense drive that is needed to take their products to the next level. My client is looking for people like you to take part in their Emerging Leaders Program that will absolutely put you in line for a promising career in IT management, and guess what? They’re going to pay for it! This is not an internship, this is a career opportunity.

 

If all the above, plus a minimum of $73K and an $8,000 sign on bonus sounds appealing to you, let's talk.

 

Call or text me today at 401-402-0449 to discuss this opportunity.

 

I look forward to hearing from you!
